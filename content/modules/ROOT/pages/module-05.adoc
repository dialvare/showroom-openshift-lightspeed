= Simplify VM management with OpenShift Lightspeed

As we mentioned in the previous module, OpenShift Virtualization allows you to run virtual machines alongside your containerized workloads. Virtual machines in OpenShift are managed as custom resources, which means OpenShift Lightspeed can help you understand, configure, and troubleshoot them just like any other OpenShift resource.

This lab environment comes with OpenShift Virtualization already deployed and configured. You can start working with virtual machines right away. In this module, we'll explore how OpenShift Lightspeed assists with virtualization workloads across different user scenarios—from newcomers learning the basics to experienced admins migrating from other platforms.

== New Virtualization User

If you're new to OpenShift Virtualization, there's a lot to learn. OpenShift Lightspeed can help you understand the key concepts and resources you'll be working with.

For example, two important concepts when it comes to creating your first virtual machine in OpenShift Virtualization are InstanceTypes and VM Templates. Let's ask OpenShift Lightspeed to explain the difference:

[source,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
What's the difference between a VM InstanceType and a VM Template?
----

OpenShift Lightspeed will provide a clear explanation of both concepts, when it makes sense to use one or either and the difference between both resources. 

This kind of conceptual guidance helps you quickly understand the building blocks of OpenShift Virtualization and provides direct links to the relevant documentation sections if you want to dive deeper.

Now that the difference is clear the new Virtualization user can decide what to choose. For example, let's see what's the procedure to create a virtual machine from a template:

[source,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
How do I create a Fedora VM from a template?
----

OpenShift Lightspeed provides the guidance needed to navigate the cluster in order to create the virtual machine. As you can see, in just 5 minutes you were able to spin up your first virtual machine with seamless effort. The initial learning curve is much easier thanks to the assistance that OpenShift Lightspeed provides.

== User Coming from a Different Platform

If you're migrating to OpenShift Virtualization from another platform like VMware, you might be familiar with different terminology. The good news is that OpenShift Lightspeed understands this and can help you translate concepts between platforms.

Let's try an example. If you come from a VMware background, you're probably familiar with vMotion—VMware's technology for live migrating VMs between hosts. Let's ask OpenShift Lightspeed about this:

[source,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
How do I vMotion a VM in OpenShift Virtualization?
----

OpenShift Lightspeed understands that you're asking about live migration using VMware terminology. It will explain that the OpenShift Virtualization equivalent is called **Live Migration**, and likely it will provide you with information on how to proceed in OpenShift Virtualization.

This capability is incredibly valuable because it allows users to keep using the terminology they're already familiar with and learn the OpenShift Virtualization equivalents naturally over time by getting answers that bridge their existing knowledge with new concepts.

== Troubleshooting Virtual Machines

Just like with containerized workloads, things can go wrong with virtual machines. Let's combine what we've learned about cluster interaction and resource attachments to troubleshoot a VM issue.

First, let's use cluster interaction to check if there are any VMs having problems. Clear your chat session and ask:

[source,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
Are there any VMs failing in the cluster?
----

OpenShift Lightspeed will use cluster interaction tools to query the VirtualMachine resources across your cluster. You should see that there's a Fedora VM in a Pending state that's failing to start.

Now let's dig deeper into what's wrong with this VM. In the OpenShift console, navigate to *Virtualization* in the left menu, then click on *VirtualMachines*. Find the Fedora VM that's in Pending state and click on the VM name to open its details page.

Now, return to the OpenShift Lightspeed chat interface. Then click the *+* button to attach information. Go ahead and attach the *Full YAML* for this VM.

Then you can ask:

[source,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
Why is this VM not starting?
----

OpenShift Lightspeed will analyze the attached YAML and identify the problem: there's a nodeSelector in the VM configuration that's trying to schedule the VM on nodes with a specific label, but no nodes in your cluster match that label.

The response will likely explain why the VM can't be scheduled (no matching nodes) and how to fix it—either by removing the nodeSelector, modifying it to match available nodes, or adding the required label to appropriate nodes

This demonstrates how OpenShift Lightspeed can troubleshoot virtual machine issues using the same attachment techniques you learned for containerized workloads. Whether you're dealing with pods or VMs, the troubleshooting workflow is consistent and intuitive.

== Key Takeaways

Congratulations! You've completed this comprehensive journey through OpenShift Lightspeed's capabilities. Throughout this lab, you've learned how to leverage OpenShift Lightspeed for much more than just answering basic questions. You started with simple queries and YAML generation, then progressed to integrating your organization's specific knowledge through BYOK, using real-time cluster interaction for dynamic troubleshooting, adding resource attachments to diagnose complex issues, and finally extending all these capabilities to virtual machine workloads.

This lab has only scratched the surface of what's possible. OpenShift Lightspeed continues to evolve with new features and capabilities. We encourage you to keep exploring—try it with your own workloads, integrate your team's documentation, and discover new ways it can streamline your OpenShift operations. The more you use OpenShift Lightspeed, the more productive you'll become with OpenShift.

Thank you for taking the time to master OpenShift Lightspeed. We hope this assistant becomes an invaluable part of your daily OpenShift workflow!
