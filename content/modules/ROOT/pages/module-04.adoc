== Troubleshooting

In your environment there is a pod that is failing to schedule for some reason. In the OpenShift console, click _Workloads_ on the left, then _Pods_, and then make sure to select the project named `broken` from the dropdown at the top of the page:

Now, in the pod list, click on the one pod which you can see is in the _Pending_ state.

Navigate to the chat interface. Make sure to click the _Clear Chat_ button in the OpenShift Lightspeed interface. Then, click the _+_ button to attach information. In this case, as this pod is currently _Pending_, there are no logs we can attach, and we don't really care about the events, either. Go ahead and attach the _Filtered YAML_, which will include the status information for this pod.

Then, simply ask:

[source,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
What's wrong with this pod?
----

You should get some detailed information about nodes and node selectors.

Now go ahead and attach the complete YAML, and then simply ask:

[source,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
Can you fix it?

Fortunately, this is a pretty obvious typo: `worker` is spelled wrong. And, GPT-4 is a very capable model, so it suggests that this typo might be the problem, and suggests some ways for you to fix it.

Can you see how the simple act of attaching details to your request can dramatically improve troubleshooting outcomes?

Note that you can attach multiple things to your request at the same time, like a service, a route, and a deployment. This can make more complicated troubleshooting scenarios easier.
