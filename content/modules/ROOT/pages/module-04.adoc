= Troubleshooting issues in the cluster

Time to put OpenShift Lightspeed to the real test. The key to effective troubleshooting with OpenShift Lightspeed is using the resource attachment feature. By clicking the *clip* icon in the chat interface, you can attach YAML definitions and other components to your question, giving the AI assistant the precise context it needs to diagnose the problem.

== Attaching Resources to the Query

In your environment there is a pod that is failing to schedule for some reason. In the OpenShift console, click *Workloads* on the left, then *Pods*, and then make sure to select the project named `broken` from the dropdown at the top of the page:

Now, in the pod list, click on the *broken-pod* which you can see is in the _Pending_ state.

Navigate to the chat interface. Make sure to click the *Clear Chat (x)* button in the OpenShift Lightspeed interface. Then, click the *clip* button to attach information. In this case, as this pod is currently _Pending_, there are no logs we can attach, and we don't really care about the events, either. Go ahead and attach the *Filtered YAML*, which will include the status information for this pod.

Then, simply ask:

[source,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
What's wrong with this pod?
----

You should get some detailed information about nodes and node selectors.

Now go ahead and attach the *Full YAML*, and then ask:

[source,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
Can you fix it?
----

Fortunately, this is a pretty obvious typo: `worker` is spelled wrong. And, GPT-4 is a very capable model, so it suggests that this typo might be the problem, and suggests some ways for you to fix it.

Can you see how the simple act of attaching details to your request can dramatically improve troubleshooting outcomes?

Note that you can attach multiple things to your request at the same time, like a service, a route, and a deployment. This can make more complicated troubleshooting scenarios easier.

== Lightspeed Beyond Containers

So far, we've explored how OpenShift Lightspeed helps with traditional containerized workloads like pods, deployments, routes, and services. But OpenShift is more than just containers. What about virtual machines?

With OpenShift Virtualization, you can run virtual machines alongside your containers on the same OpenShift platform. And here's the interesting part: at the end of the day, virtual machines in OpenShift are just OpenShift custom resources. This means OpenShift Lightspeed can help you with your virtual machine workloads too. Whether you need to understand VM networking, troubleshoot a VM that won't start, or generate YAML for a new virtual machine configuration, OpenShift Lightspeed has the knowledge to assist you.
