= Simplify VM management with OpenShift Lightspeed

As we mentioned in the previous module, OpenShift Virtualization allows you to run virtual machines alongside your containerized workloads. Virtual machines in OpenShift are managed as custom resources, which means OpenShift Lightspeed can help you understand, configure, and troubleshoot them just like any other OpenShift resource.

This lab environment comes with OpenShift Virtualization already deployed and configured. You can start working with virtual machines right away. In this module, we'll explore how OpenShift Lightspeed assists with virtualization workloads across different user scenarios—from newcomers learning the basics to experienced admins migrating from other platforms.

[#new-virtualization-users]
== New Virtualization User

If you're new to OpenShift Virtualization, there's a lot to learn. OpenShift Lightspeed can help you understand the key concepts and resources you'll be working with.

For example, two important concepts when it comes to creating your first virtual machine in OpenShift Virtualization are InstanceTypes and VM Templates. Click the *Clear Chat (x)* button and then ask OpenShift Lightspeed to explain the difference between both resources:

[source,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
What's the difference between a VM InstanceType and a VM Template?
----

OpenShift Lightspeed will provide a clear explanation of both concepts, when it makes sense to use one or either and the difference between both resources. 

This kind of conceptual guidance helps you quickly understand the building blocks of OpenShift Virtualization and provides direct links to the relevant documentation sections if you want to dive deeper.

Now that the difference is clear the new Virtualization user can decide what to choose. For example, let's see what's the procedure to create a virtual machine from a template:

[source,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
How do I create a Fedora VM from a template?
----

OpenShift Lightspeed provides the guidance needed to navigate the cluster in order to create the virtual machine. As you can see, in just 5 minutes you were able to spin up your first virtual machine with seamless effort. The initial learning curve is much easier thanks to the assistance that OpenShift Lightspeed provides.

[#users-coming-from-different-platforms]
== User Coming from a Different Platform

If you're migrating to OpenShift Virtualization from another platform like VMware, you might be familiar with different terminology. The good news is that OpenShift Lightspeed understands this and can help you translate concepts between platforms.

Let's try an example. If you come from a VMware background, you're probably familiar with vMotion—VMware's technology for live migrating VMs between hosts. Let's ask OpenShift Lightspeed about this:

[source,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
How do I vMotion a VM in OpenShift Virtualization?
----

OpenShift Lightspeed understands that you're asking about live migration using VMware terminology. It will explain that the OpenShift Virtualization equivalent is called **Live Migration**, and likely it will provide you with information on how to proceed in OpenShift Virtualization.

This capability is incredibly valuable because it allows users to keep using the terminology they're already familiar with and learn the OpenShift Virtualization equivalents naturally over time by getting answers that bridge their existing knowledge with new concepts.

[#troubleshooting-virtual-machines]
== Troubleshooting Virtual Machines

Just like with containerized workloads, things can go wrong with virtual machines. Let's combine what we've learned about cluster interaction and resource attachments to troubleshoot a VM issue.

First, let's use cluster interaction to check if there are any VMs having problems. Clear your chat session and ask:

[source,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
Are there any VMs failing in the cluster?
----

OpenShift Lightspeed will use cluster interaction tools to query the VirtualMachine resources across your cluster. You should see that there's a RHEL 9 VM in a ImagePullBackOff state that's failing to start.

Now let's dig deeper into what's wrong with this VM. In the OpenShift console, navigate to *Virtualization* in the left menu, then click on *VirtualMachines*. Make sure the project selected is *All Projects*. Find the RHEL 9 VM that's in failing and click on the VM name to open its details page.

Now, return to the OpenShift Lightspeed chat interface. Then click the *clip* button to attach information. Go ahead and attach the *Full YAML* for this VM.

Then you can ask:

[source,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
Why is this VM not starting?
----

OpenShift Lightspeed will analyze the attached YAML and identify the problem: the container image _quay.io/containerdisks/rhel:9-latest_ cannot be pulled because access to the resource is unauthorized.

The response will likely explain why the container imag can't be pulled and some suggestions to be able to fix it.

This demonstrates how OpenShift Lightspeed can troubleshoot virtual machine issues using the same attachment techniques you learned for containerized workloads. Whether you're dealing with pods or VMs, the troubleshooting workflow is consistent and intuitive.
